#Creational desgin patterns
- Factory method: Provides interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows    subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Abstract factory method: Produces families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Builder: Construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
- Prototype: Copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
- Singleton: Ensures that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

#Structural design patterns
- Adapter: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- Bridge: Split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
- Composite: Compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
- Decorator: Attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
- Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
- Flyweight
- Proxy
