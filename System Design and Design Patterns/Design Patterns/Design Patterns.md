#Creational desgin patterns
- Factory method: Provides interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows    subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Abstract factory method: Produces families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Builder: Construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
